## Introduction

When building mobile apps that serve multiple brands, it’s tempting to think of white-labeling as a surface-level problem — swap a logo here, change a primary color there, and you’re done. But in reality, building a scalable, maintainable **white-label system** is far from trivial.

At my last company, a SaaS platform serving the pet care industry, we began receiving requests from larger businesses who wanted more than just a shared booking experience. These enterprise-level clients needed their own app — something that looked, felt, and operated as an extension of their brand.

They wanted brand control, tailored workflows, and a direct customer relationship — not just a logo slapped on a shared system.

We chose React Native as our foundation, but quickly realized that traditional monolithic app structures couldn’t scale to support this level of variability. We had to rethink architecture, theming, deployment, and developer experience — all while maintaining performance, code clarity, and time-to-market.

This article is a practical breakdown of how we designed a white-label mobile app system using React Native. You’ll see the lessons we learned in architecture, theming, feature isolation, deployment automation, and the internal tooling we built to stay sane.

## 1. Architecture Foundation

At the core of our white-label system was a simple principle:

**Shared codebase, isolated behavior.**

We needed an architecture that could power multiple branded apps without duplicating business logic or bloating the main app. At the same time, each brand needed to have its own look, behavior, and in some cases, unique features.

We made three key architectural decisions to enable this:

### Monorepo Setup

We adopted a monorepo structure using tools like Yarn Workspaces and TypeScript project references. This allowed us to separate concerns cleanly:

- core/: shared logic and UI components
- brand-configs/: per-brand configuration, assets, and override logic
- apps/: shell apps for each brand, importing from the same shared core

### Config-Driven Runtime

We introduced a config-driven runtime system. On app launch, the appropriate config (theme, features, localization, etc.) is loaded based on the build target or user context.

This ensured every brand could define:

- Colors, typography, and logos
- Feature toggles
- Layout and navigation structure
- Regional behaviors

### Modular Entry Points

Each brand had its own entry file that initialized the app with the right configuration. This made it easy to:

- Deploy separate binaries
- Maintain clear boundaries
- Gate features per brand cleanly

## 2. Brand Theming System

Supporting multiple brands isn’t just about colors and logos. It’s about building a system where every component feels native to the brand — without duplicating UI logic.

### Tokenized Design Language

We used design tokens for everything — spacing, color, typography, radius. This allowed us to reskin the app for each brand by injecting a new theme config, without touching the component code.

```ts
const themeBrandA = {
  primaryColor: '#FF7F50',
  headingFont: 'Garamond',
  borderRadius: 8,
}
```

### Brand-as-a-Plugin Model
Some brands needed custom flows or UI. We allowed overrides via a plugin model:

```ts
export const brandOverrides = {
  BookingFlow: CustomBookingFlow,
  SupportWidget: null,
}
```

### Preview & Design Collaboration
We built a theme preview sandbox to allow designers and PMs to toggle between brands and preview component states visually — which sped up feedback loops and improved alignment.

## 3. Feature Flag Strategy

When you’re supporting multiple brands with varying needs, it’s easy to fall into the trap of deeply nested *"if (brand === X)"* logic. That way lies chaos.

To prevent this, we leaned heavily into a structured feature flag system — one that could support brand-specific toggles, staged rollouts, and dynamic behavior, all while keeping the code clean.

### Centralized Feature Registry
We created a centralized feature registry, where each flag was defined with a clear name, description, and default value:

```ts
export const features = {
  enableLoyaltyProgram: {
    description: 'Show loyalty points and rewards UI',
    default: false,
  },
  enableRealtimeTracking: {
    description: 'Display realtime location during appointment',
    default: false,
  },
}
```

At runtime, the active brand’s feature config would override the defaults as needed.

### Consistent Flag Usage
Rather than scattering logic throughout the UI, we wrapped every feature flag in a helper hook:

```ts
const { isEnabled } = useFeatures()
if (isEnabled('enableRealtimeTracking')) {
  return <RealtimeTracker />
}
```

This gave us a single source of truth for flag status, and enabled flexible logging, analytics, and testing support behind the scenes.

### Lifecycle-Safe

We were careful to design the system so flags were read-only during runtime, avoiding race conditions or unpredictable behavior in production apps. For experimentation or staged rollout, flags were precompiled into builds, with support for updating via remote config where needed.

### Why Not Just Use Remote Config?

In early stages, we prioritized build-time flags for their predictability and simplicity. As the product matured, we introduced support for remote config via Firebase for use cases like:

- A/B testing new feature UIs
- Emergency disabling of unstable modules
- Region-specific compliance toggles

This hybrid approach gave us both confidence during development and flexibility in production.

## 4. CI/CD and Deployment Automation

Managing a single mobile app is already a challenge. Managing dozens of branded apps, each with different assets, configurations, and release schedules? That’s where things get tricky.

From the beginning, we knew that manual app builds wouldn’t scale — so we invested heavily in CI/CD automation to keep our process sane.

### Brand-aware Build Pipelines

We used GitHub Actions combined with custom scripts to automate builds per brand. Each app had its own build command that injected:

- The appropriate theme and feature config
- App icons, splash screens, and name
- Firebase and environment credentials

```bash
yarn build:brand --target=brandA --platform=ios
```

This allowed us to trigger builds dynamically with just a few inputs. New brand? No problem — just add a config file, and it plugs into the same pipeline.

### Preflight Checks

Before any app made it to staging or production, we ran automated checks for:

- Config completeness (e.g. missing assets or colors)
- Incompatible flag combinations
- Screenshots and metadata preview (via Expo or Detox)

These checks caught 90% of brand-specific issues early — reducing QA bottlenecks and post-deploy fire drills.

### Staging Previews for Stakeholders

For stakeholders or brand partners who wanted to “see before we ship,” we provided per-brand staging builds distributed via TestFlight and Firebase App Distribution.

Each staging build came with:

- Auto-generated release notes based on commits
- QR code download links
- Snapshot previews of key screens

This gave non-engineers a clear, frictionless way to validate their brand’s app — reducing back-and-forth and last-minute changes.

### App Store Automation

We automated app store submissions (iOS and Android) using fastlane, which handled:

- Uploading binaries
- Updating screenshots and descriptions
- Notifying the team on submission success/failure

This freed up our engineers to focus on features, not publishing logistics — and helped us maintain consistent release cadences across all brands.

## 5. Lessons Learned and Takeaways

Designing a scalable white-label mobile system wasn’t just a technical challenge — it was a shift in how we approached flexibility, maintainability, and product velocity.

### Contain Complexity

Embrace complexity, but don’t let it leak everywhere. Isolate overrides. Keep shared code clean.

### Think Platform, Not Just Product

Your job is to build a reliable, configurable platform — not just an app. That means investing in tooling, documentation, and DX.

### Automate Early

Without CI/CD, white-labeling becomes an operational nightmare. Start with automation from day one.

### Be Rigid About Flexibility

Not everything should be configurable. Guardrails help teams move faster and avoid regressions.

### Let Business Value Guide You

Ultimately, the system succeeded because it supported customer needs, enabled growth, and provided a clear competitive edge. That business alignment made every architectural decision worth it.

## Final Thoughts

White-labeling at scale forces you to think deeply about modularity, ownership, and clarity. But with the right foundation, it can be a powerful enabler of product growth and user trust.

In the end, we weren’t just swapping logos.
We were building an engine for brand expression — one that scaled with confidence.
