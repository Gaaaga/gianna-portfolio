## It Starts with Empathy

> Great products don’t start with specs. They start with empathy.

I still remember hopping on a video call with a pet groomer for the first time. In the background, dogs were barking, a blow dryer was buzzing, and she was answering client texts while trimming a squirmy pup.

She wasn’t looking for “another software.” She just wanted something that *worked* — something that didn’t get in the way.

That moment stuck with me.

It became the starting point of our Online Booking project at my last company.
And more than that — it was the moment I started shifting how I saw my role.

Not just as an engineer writing code, but as someone who builds with context, purpose, and empathy. Someone who asks, *Why does this even matter to the person using it?*

## Designing with Purpose

> We didn’t start with a spec. We started with a feeling.

When we kicked off the project, we had no shortage of input — feature requests, market comparisons, internal goals. But more checkboxes didn’t mean more value.

So we slowed down and zoomed in.

We asked:

- What’s the **minimum** that makes this useful?
- What do users do when they’re **not** using our product?
- Where do they drop off, and why?

Instead of building a lite version of everything, we designed a **focused MVP** that solved one core pain point — making it easy for pet businesses to manage bookings, and even easier for pet owners to make one.

The result?
A tool that let each business configure their schedule, services, and booking logic — while customers could book, cancel, and reschedule through a simple, mobile-first experience.

It didn’t just work. It felt good to use.


## Thinking Beyond Delivery

> Shipping isn’t the finish line. It’s the starting gate.

After launch, I didn’t jump back into Jira.
I went back to users.

We tracked behavior, watched session replays, followed up with early adopters, and listened closely to their struggles and workarounds.

Some of our best improvements came from these conversations — things we hadn’t planned for, but made a real difference once we saw how people were actually using the product.

Over time, Online Booking became not just a tool, but a core part of how many pet businesses ran their daily operations — driving meaningful adoption and helping our platform grow alongside our users.


## What It Takes to Be Product-Minded

Not every engineer needs to be product-minded.

But if you’re curious, here’s what helped me grow into it:

- **Talk to users.** You’ll be amazed at what you learn from “obvious” questions.
- **Ask why — constantly.** Good answers usually come after the third or fourth ‘why’.
- **Learn to say no.** It’s the hardest — and most important — part of early-stage product thinking.
- **Zoom in, zoom out.** Details matter. So does the big picture.
- **Care.** Not just about clean code, but about whether it actually *matters*.


## A Final Thought

The best engineers I’ve worked with didn’t just write elegant code — they asked better questions, challenged assumptions, and cared deeply about the people on the other side of the interface.

Product-minded engineering isn’t about changing your title. It’s about changing your lens.
If you're already wondering *why this matters*, you’re probably closer than you think.

Let’s keep building — not just what works, but what matters.
