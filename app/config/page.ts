  description: [
    "Hi🙋🏻‍♀️, I'm Gianna, a frontend engineer with nearly a decade of experience crafting thoughtful, scalable products across SaaS, B2B, and B2C.",
    "From fast-moving MVPs to scalable platforms, I've led projects across SaaS, fintech, and creative tools, combining deep technical focus with strong product intuition. I care deeply about building things that are not just functional, but meaningful, grounded in real user needs and delivered with a high bar for quality and clarity.",
    "What sets me apart is the way I bridge engineering, product, and design. I believe great software comes not just from clean code, but from understanding the 'why' behind every feature, and aligning teams to deliver real impact.",
    "I'm currently based in Melbourne🇦🇺, continuing my journey as a builder, problem solver, and design-driven engineer."
