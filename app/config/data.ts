Many team members were also passionate photographers and heavy users of the product. That created a rare kind of feedback loop, where every UI detail mattered. It gave me a lasting appreciation for building creative tools that don‚Äôt just function well, but feel intuitive and empowering to use.",

With multiple business units maintaining separate Android, iOS, and web implementations of the same workflows, it created heavy duplication and slowed down iteration.\nI led the design and development of a cross-platform component system using React.js and React Native, aiming for high reusability, platform abstraction, and safe customizability. I worked closely with stakeholders across business lines to gather requirements, define component layers, and standardize design and behavior across teams. The system significantly reduced duplicated efforts and made business rollout much faster and more consistent.\nThis project gave me valuable experience in driving technical alignment within a large organization, and deepened my understanding of building scalable systems in complex, regulated environments.",

Working closely with backend engineers and product managers, I helped deliver a performant and scalable user experience under real-world logistics conditions.\nBeyond the core platform, I also developed companion mobile apps, including a customer ordering app and a traceability app that allowed end consumers to scan products and access food safety information. Although the traceability app was simple, it made a strong business impact, becoming a popular paid add-on for enterprise customers.\nThis experience gave me a deeper appreciation of how thoughtful engineering, even in small tools, can drive real value for users and unlock business growth.",
