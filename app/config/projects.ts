      overview: "As MoeGo grew, we saw a gap, that larger pet businesses needed more than a generic scheduling tool. They needed a direct way to engage customers.\n\nTo meet this need, I led the development of the Branded App System, enabling businesses to manage appointments, payments, promotions, and customer interactions within their own fully branded mobile app.\n\nTo ensure scalability, we designed a flexible architecture, allowing businesses to configure features based on their operational needs. This included real-time updates, appointment tracking, customer messaging, and integrated payments.\n\nWithin the first launch phase, the Branded App saw a high adoption within two weeks among early adopters, reinforcing the need for a fully customized solution in the pet industry. Additionally, this solution played a key role in securing multiple enterprise deals, positioning MoeGo as a viable solution for larger-scale pet businesses.",
